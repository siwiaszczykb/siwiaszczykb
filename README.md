## Projects

### [Ethernet Encoder](#)
A group project in which we have implemented a simplified encoder in the IEEE 802.3 100BASE-TX standard - a 4B5B encoder. We used LTSpice for electronic simulation and LaTeX to create documentation.

### [Battleships](#)
This project involves the implementation of the classic battleships game using C++ and the SFML library. The game was developed following object-oriented programming paradigms.

### [Map](#)
This project involves the implementation of a program to determine the shortest route between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm. The program is written in C++ utilizing data structures such as vectors, maps, pairs, and queues.
